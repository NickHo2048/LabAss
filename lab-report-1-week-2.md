Step 1: CSE15 Account Setup
Go to account lookup, enter your regular username/PID, then click on the cs15l... account, and click on password change. Then, it takes you to global password reset, where you login with your regular username/PID, and enter your current password and your new password; scroll down to change my tritonlink password (make it no instead of yes), and then check password. At this point, it should take you to a page that says wait 15 minutes.
